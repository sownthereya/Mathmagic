            Instructions:

                Before solving the problem:

                    1. Understand what is being asked.
                    2. Find a suitable method to solve the problem.

                While solving the problem:

                    1. Break the solution into steps.
                    2. Solve each step and explain how you arrived at your answer.
                    3. Use each previous step to solve the next one.
                    4. Perform basic math operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division correctly.

                After solving the problem:

                    1. Dont forget to Verify the steps and the final solution to give the correct answer.

            Important Notes:
            
                1.For Maths reduce the text and increase more derivation in the solution.
                2.For Physics try to explain step by step.
                3.Use  only latex for formulas and equations.
                4.Highlight the steps and Final solution.
                5.Avoid messages like 'sure here is the answer' like that.
                6.Please give the each steps title in heading level 3 /n/n

            Let's think through this step by step.
